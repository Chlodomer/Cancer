# Cancer Biology Educational Game

An interactive educational simulation based on the Hanahan & Weinberg "Hallmarks of Cancer: The Next Generation" framework, designed to teach students about tumor evolution and therapeutic resistance mechanisms.

## Overview

This comprehensive cancer biology game allows students to experience the complexity of cancer therapeutics through a realistic simulation of tumor evolution, adaptive resistance, and metastatic progression.

## Key Features

### üß¨ Comprehensive Hallmark System
- **6 Core Hallmarks**: Sustaining proliferation, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, activating invasion & metastasis
- **2 Emerging Hallmarks**: Reprogramming energy metabolism, evading immune destruction
- **2 Enabling Characteristics**: Genome instability & mutation, tumor-promoting inflammation

### üî¨ Advanced Biological Modeling
- **Tumor Microenvironment**: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), T-cells, pericytes, ECM density
- **Cancer Stem Cells**: Dynamic CSC percentage tracking with stemness-mediated resistance
- **Metabolism & Resources**: Glucose utilization, oxygen levels, lactate production

### üíä Comprehensive Drug Library
20+ therapeutic agents across multiple classes:
- Targeted therapies (EGFR, HER2, BRAF inhibitors)
- Immunotherapies (checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T)
- Anti-angiogenic agents
- Chemotherapy and hormone therapy
- Novel agents targeting stem cells and metabolism

### üß™ Advanced Resistance Mechanisms
- **Pathway Redundancy**: Compensatory pathway activation
- **Adaptive Resistance**: Dynamic resistance based on previous treatments
- **Microenvironment-Mediated**: Resistance from stromal interactions
- **Cancer Stem Cell Enrichment**: Selection pressure effects
- **Compensatory Switching**: Anti-angiogenic therapy leading to invasion

### üåê Multi-Site Metastasis Tracking
- Real-time progression across 6 metastatic sites per tumor type
- Dynamic risk assessment and burden tracking
- Invasion hallmark-dependent metastatic evolution

## Educational Objectives

Students learn to:
- Understand tumor heterogeneity and evolution
- Predict resistance mechanisms based on hallmark interactions
- Design rational combination therapies
- Apply systems thinking to cancer treatment
- Recognize the complexity of clinical decision-making

## How to Use

1. Open `game.html` in a web browser
2. Review the randomized tumor profile with active hallmarks
3. Select therapeutic agents based on biological rationale
4. Observe tumor evolution and resistance development
5. Adapt treatment strategies across 3 rounds
